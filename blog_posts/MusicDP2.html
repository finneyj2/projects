<p> My first observation from my exploratory data analysis was that most participants reported that their mood improved while listening to music. This held true regardless of whether they played instruments(82%) or not(72%); however, instrumentalists and non-instrumentalists did seem to have differences in music preferences. Specifically, nearly a third of instrumentalists report never listening to hip-hop, compared to approximately 1/5th of the general population reporting the same. This led me to hypothesize a correlation between being an instrumentalist and music preferences. Since fewer instrumentalists appear to be listening to hip-hop, I also sought to investigate whether the same may be true for related genres such as Kpop and R&B.

<p>>In order to properly measure this, I ran an ordinary least squares regression with multiple different identities serving as the IVs, while music genres remained the dependent variable. The genres included were Classical, Country, EDM, Folk, Gospel, Hip hop, Jazz, K pop, Latin, Lofi, Metal, Pop, R&B, Rap, Rock, and video game music. I conducted the analysis using python, specifically the statsmodels and pandas libraries. </p>

<p>As you can see above, this process was fairly simple. I used a for-loop and a string cast because I didn’t want to run 16 individual regression analyses per new IV.  This process was repeated for all of the linear regression analyses I conducted. </p>

<p>Then I ran additional analysis with different identities as the IV. Four IVs were analyzed in total. All reflected how participants identify themselves in terms of their relationship with music: </p>
<li> instrumentalist (yes vs. no) </li>
<li>composer (yes vs. no) </li>
<li> multilingual music fan identity (listens to multilingual music vs. does not) </li>
<li> Musician (yes vs no: yes was coded as identifying as either an instrumentalist or a composer; no was coded as identifying as neither)) </li>

<p>The instrumentalist identity only had a significant relationship with about half of the genres; The model predicted instrumentalists would listen to Jazz, Latin, and Classical music more frequently, but listen to  Hip-Hop, Pop, R&B, EDM, and Rap less frequently. The composer identity had a much smaller berth of impact, predicting more frequent listening to Jazz, Metal, and Classical music. Being a fan of music outside of one’s native language predicted more frequent listening to almost all genres. The exceptions, Country, Gospel and Rock, were not predicted by this identity at all. Generally, identifying as a musician tended to predict listening to Classical, Jazz, and Metal more frequently than the general populace; however, they tended to listen to Hip-Hop, Pop, R&B and Rap less frequently. </p> 

<p>After this, I ran a regression analysis on the role of age. With the exception of R&B and Rock, Age impacted how often people listened to all genres. The older participants were, the more often they listened to Classical, Country, Folk and Jazz. However, the prediction was the complete opposite for the remaining genres, as older age predicted that participants listened to them less. </p>
Then, I ran 4 multiple regression analyses with age as the second independent variable.

<p>This analysis revealed that bringing age into the equation led some IVs to have a weaker impact than initially indicated. The Instrumentalist identity’s results remained largely the same, aside from R&B. The multiple regression analysis indicated that neither age nor instrumentalist identity predicted how often participants listen to R&B. The relationship between the composer identity and participant listening habits were unchanged when age was added to the model. Similarly, the results for multilingual music fans also remained largely unchanged, with the exception of Pop. After age was factored into the model, Pop was no longer predicted by this identity.  The Musician identity’s results were somewhat similar, as the results were largely unchanged by the consideration of age. However, Metal could no longer be predicted by the Musician identity. Additionally, its range of impact expanded to include Gospel as well, predicting an increase in frequency for that genre. 


In summation, musical identities seemed to predict listening for a variety of genres, even when age was taken into account. However, despite varying p values, all of the test results had low r squared values. This indicates that, although the IV variables can predict user listening habits, the IVs do not explain much of the variation in the DV(s). Collinearity analysis will allow further exploration into the models constructed. That will be discussed in the next article.
