      <p>  The dataset that I am using has come entirely from Catharine Rasgaitis’s Music and Mental Health Survey. Despite this, I largely ignore the mental health data that was collected from the survey. I decided to ignore this information due to the dataset’s limitations. The survey asks if the participants’ have OCD, Anxiety, Depression or Insomnia, but does not inquire about diagnosis status. And additionally, the severity of the mental illness experienced by participants is entirely measured by self reports. Generally, this negatively impacts precision and accuracy, so I did not include the mental health data.

      <p>  My final objective was to analyze property value by city and by school district. To examine property value by city, I had to take several steps. To answer my question about school district and property values, the very first step that I took was to create a variable for the columns “PRICE” and “SCHOOLDESC”, grouped by school district, from my dataframe. After that, I plotted the average price per school district on a bar graph using PANDA’s inbuilt graphing function. </p>

      <p>Before I investigated the change in property sale prices over time, I wanted to get an idea of the dataset’s overall distribution. So, I calculated the descriptive statistics for the sale prices of properties from 2012 to 2020(pictured below).</p>

      <p>Coming into this analysis of property values, I had three main elements that I wanted to investigate
<ol>
<li> How much the price of properties in PA changed approximately 8 years. </li>
<li>How much property values changed in PA per city </li>
<li>And the average price of a home per school district </li>
</ol>
	Before I discuss my questions for this dataset and how I approached answering them, I’m going to list it’s basic properties. The Property-Values dataset had 307755 individual entries across 23 columns. The columns included were Property-House-Number, Property-Fraction, Property-Address-Dir, Property-Address-Street, Property-Address-Suf, Property-Address-Unit-Desc, Property-Unit-Number, Property-City, Property-State, Property-Zip, School-Code, School-Desc, Municipal-Code, Municipal-District, Recorded-Date, Sale-Date, price, DeedBook, DeedPage, SaleCode, Sale-Desc, Instrument Type, and Instrument Description.
